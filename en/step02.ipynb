    "What is a function? A function is, to put it a little more stiffly, a set of correspondences from one variable to another. As a concrete example, let's consider the function $f(x) = x^2$ that computes the square. In that case, if $y = f(x)$, then the relationship between the variable $y$ and $x$ is determined by the function $f$. That is, the relation \"$y$ is the square of $x$\" is determined by the function $f$.\n",
