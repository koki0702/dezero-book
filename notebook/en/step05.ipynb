    "# Step 5: Theory of Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to find the derivative by numerical differentiation. However, numerical differentiation have had problems in terms of computational cost and accuracy. Backpropagation solves both of those problems! In other words, it is possible to obtain the derivative more efficiently and with a smaller error value. This step does not implement backpropagation, but only explains the theory. Then the next step is to implement backpropagation."

We start with $\\frac{dy}{dy} (=1)$ and calculate the product of $\\frac{dy}{db}$. where $\\frac{dy}{db}$ is the derivative of the function $y=C(b)$. Therefore, we can write $C'(b)$ by denoting the derivative of the function $C$ by $C'$, which is $\\frac{dy}{db}=C'(b)$. Similarly, $\\frac{db}{da}=B'(a)$ and $\\frac{da}{dx}=A'(x)$.

The important point here is that the data being propagated is all \"derivatives of $y$\". To be specific, we can see that $\\frac{dy}{dy}$, $\\frac{dy}{db}$, $\\frac{dy}{da}$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ are all propagated by \"the derivative of $y$ on the xxx\"."

In that case, the propagating derivative would be $\\frac{dx}{dx}$ → $\\frac{da}{dx}$ → $\\frac{db}{dx}$ → $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, and the derivative about $x$ would be propagated. You could also put brackets in such a way that the calculation is sequential from input to output direction. The method based on it is called \"automatic differentiation in forward mode\".

    "Many problems in machine learning can be formulated with a large number of parameters as inputs and a \"loss function\" as the final output. The output of this loss function is (in many cases) a single scalar value, which is the \"key person\". In other words, we need to find the derivative for each parameter of the loss function. In such cases, if you propagate the derivative from the output to the input direction, you can get the derivative for all the parameters with only one propagation. Because of this computational efficiency, a method to propagate the derivative in the opposite direction is used."

    "\n",
    "Looking at **Figure 5-5**, we can see that there is a clear correspondence between forward and backward propagation. For example, the variable $a$ in forward propagation corresponds to the derivative $\\frac{dy}{da}$ in backward propagation. Similarly, $b$ and $\\frac{dy}{db}$ correspond, and $x$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ correspond. We can also see that there is a correspondence between the functions. For example, the back propagation of the function $B$ corresponds to $B'(a)$, and $A$ corresponds to $A'(x)$. For example, the back propagation of the function $B$ corresponds to $B'(a)$, and $A$ corresponds to $A'(x)$. Thus, variables have \"normal values\" and \"derivative values\" and functions have \"normal calculations (forward propagation)\" and \"calculations to find the differential (backward propagation)\". That way, you can see the prospect of backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at the function node of $C'(b)$ in **Figure 5-5**. This is a derivative of the calculation $y=C(b)$, but it should be noted here that to calculate $C'(b)$, we need a value of $b$. Similarly, to find $B'(a)$, we need the value of the input $a$. What this means is that in the case of back propagation, the data used in the forward propagation will be needed prior to it. Therefore, the backpropagation implementation must first perform forward propagation and remember the value of the variable from which each function was entered--$x$, $a$, and $b$ in the example above. You can then calculate the back propagation of each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the explanation of backpropagation. It may seem somewhat complicated, but this is one of the most difficult places in the book. There may still be points that don't add up, but you'll get a better understanding by actually putting them into action. The next step is to implement backpropagation and verify it by actually running it."
